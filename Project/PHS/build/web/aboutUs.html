 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 trees are needed to make a ton of papers.
 A cord of wood is approximately 8 feet wide, 
 4 feet deep, and 4 feet high.<br>
 A cord of air-dried, dense hardwood (oak, hickory, etc.)
 weighs roughly 2 tons, about
 15-20 percent of which is water.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been estimated
 that one cord of this wood will 
 yield one of these approximate quantities of products:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 1,000-2,000 pounds of paper (depending on the process)
 942 100-page, hard-cover books
 61,370 No. 10 business envelopes
 2,700 copies of an average daily newspaper
 By studying and analyzing the TAPPI report, we calculated
 that a 100 bed Hospital which have 400 out patients uses 
 approximately 8000 papers
 per day and on an average it consumes a tree per day.<br>
